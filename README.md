# Big-Data-System-Cryptocurrencies

This repository contains results of the project during Big Data Analytics course at WUT

## How to run the project?

Each folder that start with `COMPOSE_*` contains `docker-compose.yaml` file to run different parts of the system. Study `README.md` files in each directory to see whether additional environment variables have to be set.

If the variables are set, you can run the following script to start all components:

```
./start.sh
```

In order to stop all containers, run:

```
./stop.sh
```
